## Part 1

Got the test case working in about 20 minutes, but took 2 hrs to build a
renderer to debug why the input wasn't working.

Was just a small bug in how `$disintigrate` flag was set (needed to clear it
rather than set it; reverse logic!).

Found it by using an online `Babylon.JS` viewer. See `writebabs` code.
