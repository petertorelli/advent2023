## Part 1

Easy but does not bode well for the future.

## Part 2

Ffffffffuuuuuu.....

Since there IS a solution, and 1000 lines, it feels like there should be a
minimum number of lines that intersect to define the unqiue trajectory. E.g.,
if there's only one hailstone, there's an infinite # of trajectories. If there
are two hailstones, again, an infinite number, but those are bounded by the
fact they have to pass through two lines. But with three hailstones, is there
just one solution? And aren't we working in a field, rather than a continuous
space? E.g. Each line is a number of integral multiples of the velocity
vector, does this make it easier?
