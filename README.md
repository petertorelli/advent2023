Advent of Code for 2023, done in PERL.

Why? Because PERL gets no love these days.

Day 12.2 was brutal. I solved each one in about 2-3 hours each, but day 12.2 took 4 months.

Day 14.2 was sneaky.

Day 17 example scoring was a tad confusing.

Day 20.2 solved by visual inspection of four different cycles

Day 21.2 solved with help from Excel, not a general solution though

Day 24.2 can eat it. Keeping track of all the variables, superscripts, subscripts, and signs was just annoying.

Day 25 I created a Graphviz Dotty file and ran Force Directed analysis in Gephi until the three paths appeared. I'm pretty sure a Force-Directed graph algorithm in Perl would be DOG SLOW.
